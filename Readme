🚀 AI Interview Coach

A real-time AI-powered interview analysis tool built to provide instant, honest feedback.

📌 Overview

While practicing for interviews, I realized one thing:
I needed real feedback — not just a webcam reflection.

Most mock interview tools online were paid or offered limited insights, so I decided to create my own.
Introducing AI Interview Coach, a tool that analyzes both video + audio in real time and generates a complete performance report instantly.

This project also serves as the foundation for my upcoming full-stack platform — Intix (Coming in 2025).

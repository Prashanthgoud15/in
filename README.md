🚀 AI Interview Coach

A real-time AI-powered interview analysis tool built to provide honest, instant feedback.

📌 Overview

While preparing for interviews, I realized one thing:
I needed real feedback — instantly and accurately.

Most mock interview tools online were paid, limited, or didn’t give meaningful insights.
So I built my own AI Interview Coach, which analyzes both video + audio in real time and generates a complete performance report.

This project is also the foundation of my upcoming full-stack platform — Intix (Coming in 2025).
